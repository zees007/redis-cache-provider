Overview of Redis at a Glance:

ðŸ‘‰ A distributed, in-memory data store
ðŸ‘‰ Spring Boot has good integration with Redis for distributed caching
ðŸ‘‰Suitable for: Distributed caching, caching in microservices, real-time data updates, Message Broker (MQ)

Hereâ€™s a simplified explanation of how caching typically works:

ðŸ‘‰ Check if Data is in Cache:
Before performing a time-consuming operation or fetching data from the original source (like a database), the system checks if the required data is already present in the cache.

ðŸ‘‰ Cache Hit:
If the data is found in the cache (a cache hit), it is directly retrieved from there. This avoids the need to execute complex and resource-intensive operations to fetch the data from the original source.

ðŸ‘‰ Cache Miss:
If the data is not found in the cache (a cache miss), the system fetches the required data from the original source, such as a database or an API.

ðŸ‘‰ Store Data in Cache:
After retrieving the data from the original source, the system stores a copy of it in the cache for future use. This helps to accelerate subsequent requests for the same data.

ðŸ‘‰ Expiration and Eviction:
Cached data may have an expiration time to ensure that it remains up-to-date. Additionally, caches often have a limited capacity, and when the cache is full, a mechanism called eviction may be employed to remove less frequently used or stale data to make room for new entries.
